<h1>Games of 2017</h1>

<p>Yeah, beating games again FINALLY! Wrapped up Hyper Light Drifter, which looked and sounded great and controlled very well. I'm not a big fan of the no-words storytelling model, but they did it well. I got a random urge to play Lunar and ended up playing it emulated from my living room computer. It was fun, most of the game held up well, especially its really strong ending.</p>

<p>I found out Joanne had purchased Ys Seven on her PSP and one day I sat down and started playing it. It was my first foray into the multi-character battle system they've been using for the last two games. It was much longer than other Ys games and kinda felt like Grandia in terms of graphics, characters, and story presentation. You were able to carry a lot more healing items and you didn't lose the battle until your selected three-character party was dead so you could beat almost anything with plenty of healing, lots of hack-and-slash, and not much strategy. Still it was fun, I'll definitely check out Ys VIII.</p>

<p>I started Boot Hill Heroes in 2014, but then I got busy with buying a house and fixing it up. I finally restarted it and played it through so I'd be ready to play the second one when it came out. I Kickstarted it and as a reward got to write the dialog for my own character. The wild west story, characters, and dialog was excellent. The music and graphics were very expressive and fit in well. The battle system was unique and fun. I definitely plan to play the sequel next year!</p>
