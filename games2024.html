<h1>Games of 2024</h1>

<p>I played three games, Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands, Ys IX: Monstrum Nox, and Bomb Rush Cyberfunk but I gave up before beating them. Nothing wrong with these games, I was just having a hard time concentrating long enough to have satisfying gaming sessions of any kind. I think I'll probably come back to these eventually.</p>

<p>I poked at Astro's Playroom and Chrono Trigger during the year and eventually beat them. But it was the remake of Silent Hill 2 that really drew me in and got me back into a consistent gaming routine. The original is on my all-time favorites list and the remake improved upon it in almost every way. The best part was that they changed the area layouts and added new ones so I could experience the fear of the unknown you can only get when you don't know the game like the back of your hand. I did two playthroughs and got most of the endings and look forward to another playthrough in 2025.</p>

<p>I streamed most games I played AND archived the full playthroughs, so feel free to <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/dnqpy/videos?filter=collections">check them out</a>!</p>
