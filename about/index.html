    <h1>What is dnqpy?</h1>

    <p>
      When I was a kid (maybe 8 or so), I was into video games, starting with Nintendo Entertainment
      System. My neighborhood friend liked to use a string of characters instead of his name when
      required to name a character. He said something about it being cool or whatever. I decided to
      do that too and without any thought at all I made up "DNQPY" and used it in my playthrough of
      the now iconic RPG, Dragon Warrior, on the Nintendo.

    <p>
      For some reason the name stuck with me over the years, even though I'd long moved onto more
      story-based games with default character names that I rarely changed. It became my Xbox
      gamertag as well as my website domain name and some social media accounts. The name became a
      symbol of "fun for fun's sake", along with the joy of adventure, creativity, and gaming.
      Basically, a symbol of all things which seemed opposite of the serious, logical and
      career-driven adult I had become.

      I hadn't written it down anywhere. After awhile I wondered if I possibly even misremembered it
      all these years later. In 2009, I plugged in my Nintendo and loaded my Dragon Warrior cart.
      Amazingly, the save was still there and I had confirmation that "DNQPY" was right (see
      picture).

      Today, I dedicate this website to creative works that hopefully my childhood self would be
      proud of. It's a reminder to myself that I should take a break from my daily grind and endless
      todos and make something fun. Maybe I'll leave something behind that will live longer than me.
