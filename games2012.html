<h1>Games of 2012</h1>

<p>Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP was easily the most engaging game of the year and Osmos was the most addictive. Botanicula's playful style continuously put a smile on my face. Journey was so nice, I played it twice! The second time, I tried to cross paths with a friend, but we mostly ended up on solo adventures that we shared over Skype. Portal 2 hits the "done" list as I finally played the two-player campaign. It was a joyful collaboration, but it doesn't quite measure up to the main adventure.</p>

<p>At long last, I played through Hotel Dusk and Psychonauts, which I had been meaning to do for years. Psychonauts was well worth it, but Hotel Dusk largely was not.</p>

<p>When I take out all the duplicate games I got during multiple Humble Bundles, I still got one more game than I played through. This is disappointing because I definitely got a few lame games as part of the bundles. Oh well, I'll just keep playing the games I'm most excited about and let the rest languish.</p>
