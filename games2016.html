<h1>Games of 2016</h1>

<p>The Last Guardian was finally released and my sister got it for me for Christmas! I bought a PS4 and built a small computer for the living room so gaming is looking pretty bright for 2017. That said, I didn't beat a single game this year. I did play quite a bit of Hyper Light Drifter and plan on finishing it. Osmos has been a fun distraction on my phone from time to time. I played some South Park: The Stick of Truth and even though I saw the end, I didn't count it as 'beaten' since Joanne played most of it.</p>
