    <h1>Games of 2016</h1>

    <p>
      The Last Guardian was finally released and my sister got it for me for Christmas! I bought a
      PS4 and built a small computer for the living room so gaming is looking pretty bright for
      2017. That said, I didn't beat a single game this year. I did play quite a bit of Hyper Light
      Drifter and plan on finishing it. Osmos has been a fun distraction on my phone from time to
      time. I played some South Park: The Stick of Truth and even though I saw the end, I didn't
      count it as 'beaten' since Joanne played most of it.
