<h1>Games of 2023</h1>

<p>First half of the year was "games as usual". Cesspool was a very indie turn-based RPG. Pretty buggy at the time, but chock-full of heart. I actually used my Twitch stream videos to log some bugs. I look forward to coming back to it sometime.</p>

<p>I got a Switch and also a capture device so I could stream games from it! I played through Super Mario Odyssey, which was a solid mario game. I was only slightly disappointed in the music, which wasn't the orchestral masterpiece that was Super Mario Galaxy.</p>

<p>Loop Hero was the first roguelike I've seen to the end! Very creative and eventually a bit addictive. Thanks to my sis for the recommendation!</p>

<p>And, yeah...not much gaming in the latter half of the year. What can I say, break-ups are hard...</p>

<p>I streamed most games I played AND archived the full playthroughs, so feel free to <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/dnqpy/videos?filter=collections">check them out</a>!</p>
