    <h1>Games of 2023</h1>

    <p>
      First half of the year was "games as usual". Cesspool was a very indie turn-based RPG. Pretty
      buggy at the time, but chock-full of heart. I actually used my Twitch stream videos to log
      some bugs. I look forward to coming back to it sometime.

      I got a Switch and also a capture device so I could stream games from it! I played through
      Super Mario Odyssey, which was a solid mario game. I was only slightly disappointed in the
      music, which wasn't the orchestral masterpiece that was Super Mario Galaxy.

      Loop Hero was the first roguelike I've seen to the end! Very creative and eventually a bit
      addictive. Thanks to my sis for the recommendation!

      And, yeah...not much gaming in the latter half of the year. What can I say, break-ups are
      hard...
    </p>

    <p>
      I streamed most games I played AND archived the full playthroughs, so feel free to
      <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/dnqpy/videos?filter=collections">check them out</a>!
