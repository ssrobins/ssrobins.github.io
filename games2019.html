<h1>Games of 2019</h1>

<p>Boot Hill Bounties, the follow-up to Boot Hill Heroes was tons of fun. It's a love letter to 16-bit-era RPGs and it really makes me wonder what other indie games nobody talks about I'd absolutely love?</p>

<p>Finally played indie hits Wandersong and Thimbleweed Park. Wandersong was charming and the world and characters were entertaining, but the gameplay was really light and unless you played the music perfectly, its sound was 'nails on a chalkboard'. The old-school point-and-click adventure spoof Thimbleweed Park was well done, but that sort of thing wasn't my deal so I didn't love it like others did.</p>

<p>I replayed Wild Atms on PSP for the first time since I played it the first time shortly after it was released on PlayStation. The music is timeless and the gameplay held up really well. The 2D graphics are good, but the 3D graphics definitely look ancient. The latest (last?) remake of Ys I and II FINALLY had awesomely redone music and it made me love them even more.</p>
