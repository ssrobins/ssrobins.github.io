<h1>Games of 2018</h1>

<p>I got a Super NES Classic so that's why I beat a handful of SNES games this year! Finally played the much talked about Undertale and really enjoyed it! It's the closest to a game I'd like to make: simple graphics, great music, plenty of comedy with some drama, short, and every item counts. Speaking of making games, I finally made the highly derivative and slightly playable <a href="http://dnqpy.com/stackblox/">StackBlox</a>. It was mostly to learn, but I got little glimmers of what it might be like to make something deeper. Working ever so slowly toward doing much more!</p>

<p>Finally, Earthbound. Second playthrough and I loved it more than ever. I remember during my first playthrough being annoyed at how slow walking was and how many battles there were. I guess I'm more patient or slowing down because it felt just fine now. It's so damn charming and the graphics and music are timeless. Through the Super NES Classic I finally have my own copy in English. I could see myself years from now, old as hell, playing this game (for the last time?) and having a blast.</p>
