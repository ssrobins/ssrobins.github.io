    <h1>Games of 2025</h1>

    <p>
      I was able to concentrate on more gaming this year and as a result played several! I restarted
      Cadence of Hyrule and played all the way through. It was super fun and pretty accessible once
      I got some key items. Planet of Lana was a pretty Limbo-style sidescrolling light puzzle
      platformer that was a short-and-sweet experience.

    <p>
      Shrine's Legacy, a game I had been following closely through its development, was released!
      It's an absolute love letter to the SNES-style Action RPG and I thoroughly enjoyed it. it had
      fun combat, satisfying exploration, lovable characters, and a nice story. It also had a
      two-player co-op, but I didn't have anyone to play with. Someday again, perhaps.
    </p>

      On the replay/remake front, I enjoyed Actraiser Renaissance, though it was definitely
      following the modern remake pattern of adding a bunch of filler that didn't need to be there.
      The game felt easier than the original, which was a bit of a shock given the higher difficulty
      and complexity of many modern games. It was tons of fun getting to play Final Fantasy VI
      again, and as the fourth of the Final Fantasy pixel remasters I've played, it definitely held
      to the high standard I expected.

      Twitch finally got wise to the unlimited archiving of streams you could store and imposed a
      strict limit, forcing me to delete hundreds of hours of playthroughs over the last few years.
      :(

      The final part of the update is on the website itself. I finally set up autoformatting and
      various checks for the website to make it easier to edit and produce an end result that's more
      accessible and compatible. I heavily used AI to accomplish that, but any creative part of this
      website, including this text I'm writing right now, will continue to be from a human mind!
