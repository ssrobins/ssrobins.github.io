<h1>Games of 2009</h1>

<p>On the, "played it, finally!" list was Metroid Prime 3, Final Fantasy V, Uncharted, and Braid. FFV was the most surprising since it ended up being more unique and enjoyable than I thought it would be. In some respects, it stands shoulder-to-shoulder with IV and VI. I know what you're thinking, but play ALL the way through and you may agree.</p>

<p>I played PixelJunk Eden most obsessively, with the journey to 50 spectra leading to an affliction now known as, "PixelJunk Eye". Ouch. I had a slight relapse the weekend before Christmas trying to get all the seeds in Garden 7 (I failed). I had to stop so I wouldn't look like a drug addict in holiday pictures!</p>

<p>Half-Life was my most disappointing purchase this year. People rave about it, but it became incredibly repetitive. I think I was roughly halfway through when I finally quit. Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story was going well, but I've played so many Mario RPGs that it had a "been there, done that" feeling. Metroid Prime 3 and Metroid Fusion gave me a tinge of that feeling as well, but they were still engaging enough to complete.</p>

<p>I'm so "indy" now. That's why You Have To Burn The Rope, World of Goo, Tag: The Power of Paint, and Machinarium are on the list. Short-and-sweet games that do something different are definitely appealing to me. More!</p>

<p>LEGO Batman and Pure were included in my Xbox 360 bundle and Dragon Quest Wars was a "what the hell" purchase using the free points that came with my DSi. On the other hand, I started and didn't finish Patapon, Half-Life, and Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story. Overall, I think I made a little headway on the "vital" backlog this year.</p>
