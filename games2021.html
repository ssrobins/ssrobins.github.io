<h1>Games of 2021</h1>

<p>It was quite a year of (mostly) replays. Lufia II, what a blast from the past. I bought it shortly after it was originally released, but only played it through once and never did the Ancient Cave until now. Totally holds up. It has me pining for a true sequel to wrap up the series and even had me casually consider writing something up. I even played the first Lufia, which doesn't hold up as well, but it's still enjoyable in its own right.</p>

<p>You'd think all the replaying would've made a roguelike fit right in, but dammit, I just couldn't get into Hades. It looks, sounds, and plays so smooth, but it's just soooo boring seeing the same things over and over and making so little progress. I'm sure most people would think that's my problem, given the game's critical acclaim, and they might be right. I am going to give it another try, maybe a couple rounds will fit well at the end of a long day at work.</p>

<p>For the entire year, I streamed every game I played AND archived the full playthroughs, so feel free to <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/dnqpy/videos?filter=collections">check them out</a>!</p>
