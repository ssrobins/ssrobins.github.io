<h1>Games of 2013</h1>

<p>Hardly any games were played this year, especially in the latter half! I allowed other things to take priority over gaming and I feel ok about that. I found BioShock Infinite to be quite disappointing. It was very pretty, but its atmosphere wasn't as engaging as the original and the battles were repetitive. Replays of Shadow of the Colossus and Super Metroid were fun, no surprise there!</p>

<p>The threshold at which I will make time for a game is on the rise, which means I'll probably play less, but I'll play what I'm most excited about...or so I hope!</p>
